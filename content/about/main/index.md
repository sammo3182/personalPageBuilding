intro: |
  I became a political scientist after receiving a Ph.D. in political science from the University of Iowa.
  As a political comparativist, my primary interest lies in exploring the **government-mass relationship** in the Chinese case and cross-nationally using **political-psychological, political-linguistic, and political-economic views**. 
  My recent research focuses on how the national linguistic system, socioeconomic inequality, and sociopolitical identities influence citizens' political cognition and behaviors. 
  My other studies cover a variety of topics of state media in the New-Media Era, migration policy under the "novel urbanization," internet identity construction, etc.
  
  As a political methodologist, I am interested in developing methods of **lab and survey experiments, spatial and network analyses, text analysis, and latent variable analysis**.
  Some of my published and ongoing projects include adjusting matched-guise experiments, list experiments usage expanding, and the **Dynamic Comparative Political Opinions (DCPO)** for public-opinion analyses across surveys, countries, and time. 
  And, I am an avid fan of data visualization.
  
  As a faculty member, I have worked for Tsinghua since 2019, where I teach **public policy analysis, intro to political science, political method foundations, and big data analysis for governance**. 
  I am also the founder of **"Learning R with Dr. Hu" year-long workshop** and serve as the deputy director of the Tsinghua Computational Social Science Platform (清华大学计算社会科学平台) and Tsinghua Center on Data and Governance (清华数据治理中心).
