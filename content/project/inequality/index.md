This project delves into socioeconomic disparities, examining the systematic differences in income, assets, mobility, and access to resources among citizens. 
Our team is interested in the impact, pathways, and mechanisms of this structural property on the political decisions and behaviors of individuals and groups. 
Specifically, the project seeks to understand the dimensions of inequality that people recognize and how this recognition influences their political awareness, preferences, and choices. 
Furthermore, it investigates the origins of the public's perceptions of inequality: what---or perhaps *who*---influence these perceptions?

项目“感知不平等”聚焦社会经济不平等问题，尤其是公民在收入、资产、流动性以及资源获取等方面的系统性差异。
项目团队重点关注京极不平等结构性特征对个体和群体政治决策与行为的影响、途径和机制。
尤其是，我们试图理解人们如何识别不平等（他们关注不平等的哪些方面？），以及这种认识和理解如何影响他们的政治认知、偏好和决策。
更进一步，我们探究什么因素——或者说是谁——塑造了大众对不平等的感知。
