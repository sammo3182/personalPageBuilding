Socioeconomic inequality includes systematic discrepancies among citizens in income, assets, mobility, accessible resources, etc.
I am interested in this structural property's effects, paths, and mechanisms on individual and group political decisions and behaviors.
In particular, how do people recognize inequality (what aspects of inequality)? 
How does their awareness and understanding of inequality affect their political cognition, preferences, and decisions? 
Even more interestingly, what (or...who) forms the masses' inequality perceptions?
