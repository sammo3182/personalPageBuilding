Language is the fundamental feature of human beings. 
The debate of whether does language shapes thoughts or the other way around has inspires the greatest theorists and scientists throughout the human history.
Nevertheless, the importance of language in political lives has not been well studied yet.

Cutting in from an empirical angle, I strive to identify the influences of linguistic relativity and language planning in the government-mass relationship and the (re)construction of mass political cognition.
