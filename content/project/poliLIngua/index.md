Language is the fundamental feature of human beings. 
The debate of whether does language shapes thoughts or the other way around has inspires the greatest theorists and scientists throughout the human history.
I aim to contribute to this classic topic from a view of political science. 
Using experimental and observed studies, I strive to identify the language effect in mass political cognition and linguistic relativity in sociopolitical behaviors and attitudes.
