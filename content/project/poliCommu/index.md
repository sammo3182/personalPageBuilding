People do not merely respond to the outside world; they *recognize*, *process*, and make *choices*.
I am interested in how this psychological process is achieved within media interactions among the sender, carrier, and receiver.
This also makes my research different from the prevalent political-communication studies that focus on the content and means of the media.
Instead, I focus more on how people respond to them, for instance, what the audience actually feels, understands, and does when they are exposed to a political message from the government.
Even the more basic question is still puzzling and intriguing for research, such as who is the audience of state media, political propaganda, ideological arguments, etc, especially in the Chinese media environment.
