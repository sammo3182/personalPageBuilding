Inspired by Vincent Arel-Bundock's well-known [`countrycode`](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00848), we created `regioncode` to achieve similar functions specifically for China studies. `regioncode` enables seamlessly converting regions' formal names, common-used names, and administrative division codes between each other.
