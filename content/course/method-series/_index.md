title:  Method Courses for "Non-Math" Students

description: |
  The courses are specially designed for students who *have an interest* of quantitative methods but *don't* have a mathematical, statistical, or econometric background.
  Different from applied-method courses, students are expected to learn *not only how but why* to use a certain method in these courses.
